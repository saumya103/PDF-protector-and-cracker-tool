# PDF-protector-and-cracker-tool
The objective of this project is to create a Python-based tool that allows users to add password protection to PDF files and crack password-protected PDF files using dictionary-based and brute-force attacks.
It contains two files:
  1.protector.py: This is used to provide password protection to pdf files.
  2.cracker.py: This is used to provide crack password protected PDF files.
